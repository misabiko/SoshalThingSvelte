Tweetdeck-style timeline app to display feeds from various services in columns.

Mostly for my personal use, so the code is messy and the UI is all over the place. ðŸ˜Š

Rust version: https://github.com/misabiko/SoshalThingYew

## Why I use it (vs Tweetdeck)
- Not having every image cropped
- Mark posts as read and hide them as I read
- Having multiple sources per timeline rather than 15 individual timelines
- Multi-column timelines
- Adding timelines to other websites
- Using it for other services than Twitter (not quite there yet)

## Usage

### Dev
Build with `npm run build`
Serve the app  on `localhost:8080` with `npm run serve`
You can pass `--port <port>` to serve over a specific port

Build the extension with `npm run build:extension`
Needs a `credentials.json` in the working directory with `twitter.consumer_key` and `twitter.consumer_secret` for a Twitter app.

Test with `npm test`, it uses the port 8089 by default
